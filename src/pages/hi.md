Hi,
My name is Michel Larsson and I have been working as a developer for about 18 years, 
and last 3 years remotely, and 6 years freelancing for some of the largest companies in Sweden.
I have a great passion for writing clean code and I am very meticulous. I have also worked in most team setups, ie mob programming, pair programming and been with the fullstack as the only developer.
Hope to hear back from you
Best regards
/Michel
